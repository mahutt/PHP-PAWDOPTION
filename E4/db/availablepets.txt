1:Nina:Bert:dog:labrador retriever:6:male:dogs,children:Bert has been a joy to raise. It's rather unfortunate that I must move away to Britain for work, since Bert really isn't all that fond of the Europeen experience. He's a beautiful soul, inside and out!
2:Petunia Masteur:Jessica:cat:persian:12:female:cats:Jessica loves belly rubs, cat nip, and late night walks. She sleeps after a bowl of warm milk. Big dogs scare her, but she is capable of getting along with smaller dogs. Jessica needs her ears cleaned once a week due to a chronic ear infection.
3:Ed Sheeran:Jerry:cat:british shorthair:9:male:cats,dogs,children:Little Jerry belonged to my mother, who deeply loved her dog. Her passing means that someone else will have the privelege to love and care for Jerry.
